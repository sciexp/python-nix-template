{"id":"pnt-3qp","title":"Investigate and validate optimal test strategy for PyO3 + Python hybrid packages","description":"The current devShell excludes pnt-cli from uv2nix editableOverlay because maturin packages are incompatible with pyprojectFixupEditableHook (expects EDITABLE_ROOT which maturin does not set). This means nix develop -c pytest cannot import pnt_cli._native, failing both locally and in CI.\n\nThis task requires investigation and experimentation to determine the optimal testing strategy for packages containing both Python and Rust code via PyO3 extension modules, using maturin as the build backend and crane for Rust build artifact caching.\n\nQuestions to answer through experimentation:\n\n1. Can we install pnt-cli non-editable in the devShell virtualenv (pre-built wheel via Nix) so pytest can import _native? What are the trade-offs for developer iteration speed?\n\n2. What is the correct split between cargo nextest (pure Rust unit tests in crates/) and pytest (Python integration tests that exercise the PyO3 bindings)? Should these be separate CI jobs or a unified test recipe?\n\n3. Can maturin develop be integrated into the devShell shellHook or a just recipe to build the extension in-place for iterative development? How does this interact with the uv2nix virtualenv?\n\n4. How do the reference implementations handle this?\n   - ~/projects/nix-workspace/uv2nix — upstream patterns for maturin/PyO3 packages\n   - ~/projects/nix-workspace/pyproject.nix — Python project tooling for Nix\n   - ~/projects/nix-workspace/nix-cargo-crane — crane patterns for Rust builds\n   - ~/projects/rust-workspace/ironstar — crane devShell integration (Rust-only but relevant caching patterns)\n\n5. For the template test (omnix init + validate): should instantiated templates use nix flake check (builds everything through Nix including maturin wheel), nix develop -c uv run pytest (uv builds the wheel), or a combination?\n\n6. Does the nix build path (nix flake check / nix build) already exercise both Rust compilation (via crane cargoArtifacts) and Python tests (via pytest in check phase)? If so, it may be sufficient for CI validation without needing devShell-based testing.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Document the chosen test strategy with rationale\n- Validate that both cargo nextest (Rust unit tests) and pytest (Python integration tests) pass\n- Validate the strategy works both locally (nix develop) and in CI (template instantiation test)\n- Update devshell.nix, justfile, and template.yaml as needed to implement the chosen strategy\n- Ensure crane artifact caching is preserved (no unnecessary Rust rebuilds)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:20:11.038346-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-02-03T11:07:51.054773-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-03T11:07:51.054773-05:00","close_reason":"Resolved via test relocation: pnt-cli tests moved from src/pnt_cli/tests/ to tests/ (outside source namespace).

It has never been released. semantic-release is configured in packages/pnt-cli/package.json but predicts no pending release.\n\nResearch findings: Nix pkgsCross is not viable for PyPI wheel distribution. No project in the ecosystem uses Nix cross-compilation to produce manylinux-compatible wheels. The industry standard is GitHub Actions + maturin-action with manylinux containers for Linux and native runners for macOS. crane-maturin (vlaci/crane-maturin) provides a thin wrapper over crane that eliminates hand-rolled boilerplate for maturin builds.\n\nScope (three phases):\n\nPhase A — crane-maturin refactor (no new capabilities):\n- Add vlaci/crane-maturin as flake input (pinned)\n- Replace nix/packages/pnt-cli/rust.nix + default.nix with single buildMaturinPackage call via mkLib\n- Update modules/python.nix overlay composition to use crane-maturin's output pattern\n- Verify nix flake check and nix develop -c pytest pass for all 3 packages\n- Benefit: automatic two-phase cargo caching, PYO3_PYTHON handling, passthru.tests (pytest, clippy, doc, fmt, test, audit)\n\nPhase B — CI wheel build workflow (new capability):\n- New workflow: .github/workflows/wheel-build.yaml\n- Matrix: linux-x86_64, linux-aarch64, macos-x86_64, macos-aarch64\n- Linux: maturin-action with manylinux: auto (pure Rust, no custom containers needed)\n- macOS: native runners (macos-15 for arm64)\n- Python 3.12 only (template users extend as needed)\n- Artifact upload per platform\n- Concrete for pnt-cli but with clear parameterization points (package name, maturin args as workflow variables)\n\nPhase C — release pipeline:\n- Coordinate with existing package-release.yaml\n- Trigger: semantic-release creates tag → dispatches wheel builds → collects artifacts\n- Publish to PyPI via uv publish with trusted publishing (OIDC)\n- Include sdist alongside wheels\n- Existing

Added workspace.metadata.crane.name to silence placeholder warnings\n- Validated: nix flake check (6/6), nix develop -c pytest (2/2), nix build .#default all pass\n- Confirmed nixpkgsPrebuilt preserves passthru.dependencies for mkVirtualEnv\n\nKey learning:\n- pyproject-nix's hacks.nixpkgsPrebuilt is the correct adapter between nixpkgs buildPythonPackage outputs and pyproject-nix package sets\n- The previous overrideAttrs approach compiled Rust twice (once in cmPackage, once in the overlay via pyprojectHook + maturin)\n- nixpkgsPrebuilt strips nixpkgs propagation/wrapping and copies site-packages, taking passthru from prev\n- Cargo workspace-only root pattern (no [package] in root Cargo.toml) works with crane-maturin via manifest-path in pyproject.toml\n\nRemaining (Phase B + C):\n- Phase B: wheel-build.yaml with maturin-action matrix (linux + macOS, Python 3.12)\n- Phase C: release pipeline coordination with package-release.yaml\n\nBranch: pnt-wbq-cross-compile-wheels (4

skips single-platform uv build/publish, calls wheel-build.yaml with release tag, then publishes all artifacts via uv publish --trusted-publishing always (OIDC)\n- Added pnt-cli to ci.yaml release-packages matrix with build-wheels: true\n- Existing pure Python packages unaffected (python-nix-template, pnt-functional use existing uv build path)\n\nNote: PyPI trusted publishing requires configuring the OIDC trust relationship on PyPI for the publish-wheels job (environment: pypi). pnt-cli's package.json lacks @semantic-release/git so pyproject.toml version is not updated by semantic-release — this is a pre-existing concern for all packages.\n\nBranch: pnt-wbq-cross-compile-wheels (4 new commits)","created_at":"2026-02-04T20:20:07Z"}]}
{"id":"pnt-yty","title":"Align Cloudflare docs deployment with vanixiets preview-promote pattern","description":"Align python-nix-template docs deployment workflow with the preview-promote pattern from vanixiets and typescript-nix-template. Currently pnt has preview deployment but no production promotion logic, uses a two-job workflow with artifact upload, lacks link validation, and uses yarn-berry where vanixiets/tnt use bun.\n\nChanges required:\n\n1. Migrate from yarn-berry to bun:\n   - Remove yarn.lock, .yarnrc.yml, and any yarn configuration\n   - Add bun to the devShell (modules/devshell.nix)\n   - Replace all yarn dlx wrangler / yarn dlx references with bunx wrangler / bunx\n   - Update package.json scripts if they reference yarn\n   - Generate bun.lock (or bun.lockb) from package.json\n   - Update .gitignore for bun artifacts\n   - Update CI workflows that reference yarn\n   - This aligns tooling exactly with vanixiets and typescript-nix-template\n\n2. Add docs-deploy-production justfile recipe with version promotion logic:\n   - Look up existing wrangler version by 12-char commit SHA tag\n   - If found: promote to 100% production traffic (zero rebuild)\n   - If not found: fall back to build and deploy directly\n   - Reference: vanixiets scripts/docs/deploy-production.sh and tnt justfile docs-deploy-production\n\n3. Align docs-deploy-preview with vanixiets pattern:\n   - Branch name sanitization (40-char subdomain-safe)\n   - Git metadata capture (12-char SHA tag, commit message, clean/dirty status)\n   - Use bunx wrangler (after yarn-to-bun migration)\n\n4. Refactor deploy-docs.yaml workflow:\n   - Single-job pattern with environment branching (preview vs production)\n   - Use setup-nix composite action instead of DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action\n   - Add link validation step (just docs-linkcheck or equivalent for Quarto)\n   - Add cached-ci-job execution caching\n   - Preview triggered on PR, production triggered on push to main/beta\n\n5. Evaluate wrangler.jsonc location:\n   - Currently at repo root, vanixiets/tnt have it in packages/docs/\n   - pnt docs are in docs/ (not packages/docs/), so repo root may be appropriate\n   - Ensure assets.directory path is correct relative to wrangler.jsonc location\n\n6. Worker naming convention:\n   - Current: python-nix-template (matches repo name)\n   - vanixiets pattern: infra-docs, tnt pattern: ts-nix-docs\n   - Choose appropriate worker name for the template\n\nReference implementations:\n- ~/projects/nix-workspace/vanixiets justfile (docs-deploy-preview, docs-deploy-production), deploy-docs.yaml, packages/docs/wrangler.jsonc, scripts/docs/deploy-production.sh\n- ~/projects/nix-workspace/typescript-nix-template justfile, deploy-docs.yaml, packages/docs/wrangler.jsonc\n\nNote: pnt uses Quarto (not Astro) so build commands differ, but the wrangler deployment pattern and bun tooling are framework-agnostic.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T18:23:43.437695-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-02-03T22:16:52.24175-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-03T22:16:52.24175-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented across 18 commits on branch pnt-yty-cloudflare-docs-alignment (dd698bf..e03ca68).

Phase 2: preview-promote docs deployment (docs-deploy-preview with branch sanitization and SHA tagging, docs-deploy-production with version promotion, single-job deploy-docs.yaml with environment branching, wrangler.jsonc schema and observability). Alignment: GitHub preview/production environments created, preview-docs job runs on every PR (removed label gate), ::notice annotations for predicted semantic-release versions, preview-version.sh ported from tnt with merge-tree simulation. CI verified green on PR 45 (run 21652296092). Fix for preview-release-version local branch requirement pushed (e03ca68), awaiting CI confirmation."}
